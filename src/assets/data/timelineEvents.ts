      "Everton look too scared to try anything creative and the anxiety of the players is getting through to the crowd at Goodison Park. They are desperate to get behind their team but are not getting much to go at. Too much careless possession. Too many aimless long balls. Fear all round.",

He hits it first time, curling it towards the corner, but it takes a big deflection off the back of United captain Harry Maguire and David de Gea is completely wrong-footed. The Everton fans are going wild!",
